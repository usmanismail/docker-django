## Creating and Setting up a new project 

Note this is only needed if you have not already setup your project through django.

    # Start initial project
    docker run -it -v $PWD:/var/site django django-admin.py startproject mysite
    
    # Add static root
    echo 'STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static/")' >> mysite/mysite/settings.py
    
    # collect static files for serving with nginx
    docker run -it -v $PWD:/var/site django python /var/site/mysite/manage.py collectstatic
    
    # If you are using an internal sqlite (the default setup uses this) but you don't want to do this in production.
    docker run -it -v $PWD:/var/site django python /var/site/mysite/manage.py migrate
    
    # Actually run django
    docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/var/site -p 8000:8000 -e SITE_NAME=mysite django
    
Browse to localhost:8000 in a web browser of your choice. You should see:

If you are using boot2docker you should lookup your docker interface by using boot2docker ip and browse to the IP specified by this command instead of localhost
